User Stories

The following required functionality is complete: 

[X] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.

[X]Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.

[X]The movie poster is available by appending the returned poster_path to https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w342.

[X]User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API. You can use one of the 3rd party libraries listed on CocoaControls.

[X]User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following optional features are implemented:

[x] User sees an error message when there's a networking error. You may not use UIAlertController or a 3rd party library to display the error. See this screenshot for what the error message should look like.
Hint: Using the hidden property of a view can be helpful to toggle the network error view's visibility.

[ ]Movies are displayed using a CollectionView instead of a TableView.

[ ]User can search for a movie.
Hint: Consider using a UISearchBar for this feature. Don't use the UISearchDisplayController.

[ ]All images fade in as they are loading:
Hint: Use the - (void)setImageWithURLRequest:(NSURLRequest *)urlRequest method in AFNetworking. Create an additional category method that has a success block that fades in the image. The image should only fade in if it's coming from network, not cache.

[ ]Customize the UI. You can use Iconmonstr and The Noun Project as good sources of images.
